Define and communicate target of the workshop:

	• Should the participants become data-scientists?
		Ans. The main target of the workshop was to help candidates move towards data driven solutions and how to implement data-driven products in real world.    

	• Or do they only want to have a better understanding of the topic?
		Ans. Yes its true that better understanding of the topic was always the agenda but with better understanding you always need to understand how and when to apply the knowledge or the 			understanding will losse its grip.

	• Probably there is a difference about what a data-scientists thinks is important and what a non-data scientists needs to know?
		Ans. Yes a data-scientist that have worked on data for any industry would always know what kpi's and metrics are most important apart from a non-data scientist. A non-data scientist should 			first study about the perticular industry and its use-cases and after working for two or three industry a non-data scietist would understand that the steps and procedures how to use that 			data and what metrics will be most important. 



General:
	• Start
		○ Start was very quickly and directly into first slides
			Ans. Next time before presentation i will try to first explain the agenda for the workshop.
		○ Better start with an agenda and timetable for the workshop
			Ans. Yes next time agenda would be to help participants code during the workshop.
		○ Inform participants what is expected from them: just listening, ask questions, discuss something, etc.
			Ans. Yes I think this would be better because in the first workshop everybody was just listening  and you were the only one who asked a question.
 
	• Variations in workshop were good
		○ e.g. was always good, when you switched from slides to excel or Jupyter notebook
			Ans. I wanted the participants to be motivated during the workshop.
	• After finishing a topic leave some seconds to think about it ore prepare a question
		Ans. Yes this would be a good option.
	• Presentation setup: Turn off notifications. If possible switch to full screen presentation mode. Participants focus should be on slide only. (Was of course OK for internal audience)
		Ans. Yes that was inappropriate as i was constantly getting mails and notifications in my telegram.
